## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure DNS Settings

After purchasing your domain, you need to point it to GitHub Pages.

### DNS Configuration (Choose A or B):

#### **A. For Apex Domain** (e.g., `nomausa.org`)

Add these **4 A records** pointing to GitHub's servers:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | @ | 185.199.108.153 | 3600 |
| A | @ | 185.199.109.153 | 3600 |
| A | @ | 185.199.110.153 | 3600 |
| A | @ | 185.199.111.153 | 3600 |

**Plus** add a **CNAME record** for www:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | www | thenoma.github.io | 3600 |

#### **B. For Subdomain** (e.g., `www.nomausa.org`)

Add **1 CNAME record**:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | www | thenoma.github.io | 3600 |

---

## üîß Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository settings**:
   https://github.com/thenoma/NOMA/settings/pages

2. **In the "Custom domain" field**, enter your domain:
   - For apex: `nomausa.org`
   - For www: `www.nomausa.org`

3. **Click "Save"**

4. **Wait 24-48 hours** for DNS propagation (usually takes 1-2 hours)

5. **Check "Enforce HTTPS"** once the domain is verified
   - This may take up to 24 hours to become available
   - Provides free SSL certificate for your custom domain

## üîç Step 4: Verify Setup

### Check DNS Propagation:
Visit: https://dnschecker.org
- Enter your domain name
- Select record type (A or CNAME)
- Check if your records are showing up globally

### Test Your Website:
After DNS propagates (1-2 hours, max 48 hours):
- Visit your custom domain
- Should redirect to your NOMA website
- May show "Page not found" initially - this is normal

### Enable HTTPS:
1. After domain is verified (may take 24 hours)
2. Go back to GitHub Pages settings
3. Check "Enforce HTTPS"
4. Wait a few minutes for SSL certificate

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Domain is not properly configured"
- Wait longer - DNS takes time to propagate
- Double-check your DNS records match exactly
- Make sure you used `thenoma.github.io` (without /NOMA/)

### "Certificate error" or "Not secure"
- Wait 24 hours after adding custom domain
- Make sure "Enforce HTTPS" is checked
- Try accessing with https:// prefix

### Website shows 404
- Check that your custom domain is spelled correctly
- Verify DNS records are correct
- Clear your browser cache
- Try in incognito mode

### "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"
- Make sure GitHub Pages is still enabled
- Verify your custom domain is saved in GitHub settings
- Check that you have an `index.html` in the root

| Action | Time |
|--------|------|
| Buy domain | 5-10 minutes |
| Configure DNS | 5-10 minutes |
| DNS propagation | 1-2 hours (max 48h) |
